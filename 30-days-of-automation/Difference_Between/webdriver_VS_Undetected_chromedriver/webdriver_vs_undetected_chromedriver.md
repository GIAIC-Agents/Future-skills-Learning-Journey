# 🤖 WebDriver vs. undetected_chromedriver – Best & Simple Explanation

When it comes to automating browsers using Python and Selenium, there are **two top tools** you need to know:

---

## 🟢 1. WebDriver (Selenium Official)

`webdriver` is the **official** way to automate browsers using Selenium.

### ✅ Best For:
- Web automation for your own websites
- Testing web applications
- Safe, legal, and fully supported

### 🔍 Downside:
- Easily detected by websites with bot protection

### 🚀 Example:
```python
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://example.com")
```

---

## 🔵 2. undetected_chromedriver (Anti-Bot Ninja)

`undetected_chromedriver` is a **custom version of WebDriver** that helps you **bypass bot detection** on websites.

### ✅ Best For:
- Scraping data from websites that block bots
- Avoiding CAPTCHAs and automation detection

### ⚠ Caution:
- Not officially supported by Selenium
- Should be used responsibly

### 🚀 Example:
```python
import undetected_chromedriver as uc

driver = uc.Chrome()
driver.get("https://example.com")
```
